Rules of Use:
    1. Always use the templates provided for new modules and fill out all details
       listed for proper documention.
    2. Create each module as an individual file and use the `include "<filepath>"; directive to include it in other modules.

    3. Every module file needs a testbench for all edge cases.

    4. Only Add files to the final build modules folder if it has been fully debugged on the Basys 3 board.

    5. Always use proper variable naming in modules. - No obscurity is key to collaborating code.

    6. Bully Anti Dinga
