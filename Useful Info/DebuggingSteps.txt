When debugging in vivado:
1. Check if the synthesis and implementation are include all modules and connections properly.  
    - Vivado likes to remove and optimize away modules and net connections.

2. Always block parameters must be defined as posedge or negedge.

3. only use clk for always parameters.

4. do not use IO for always block triggers.

5. The initial block only initializes variables in simulations but will not in synthesis and implementation.
